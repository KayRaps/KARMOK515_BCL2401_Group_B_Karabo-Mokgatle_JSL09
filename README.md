## Reflection 

* It was an amazing expreince to be creating my own dashboard, learning about the APIs and how to use them. I learned a lot about how to use APIs and how to use them in my own projects. I also learned how to use JavaScript ES modules to import and export modules. I also learned how to use the manifest.json file to add a web app manifest to my project. 

* Even though I'm not perfect as of yet yet, I can see what is going on, I'm going have to go back and study more.
